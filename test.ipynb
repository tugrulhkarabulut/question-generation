      "after the lisa's announcement, john dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious \"macintosh\" project at apple in february 1983 . the company announced the macintosh 128k-manufactured at an apple factory in fremont, california-in october 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in december. the macintosh was introduced by a us$1.5 million ridley scott television commercial, \"1984\". it most notably aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january 22, 1984, and is now considered a \"watershed event\" and a \"masterpiece.\" regis mckenna called the ad \"more successful than the mac itself.\" \"1984\" used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the macintosh (indicated by a picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the \"conformity\" of ibm's attempts to dominate the computer industry. the ad alludes to george orwell's novel, nineteen eighty-four, which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised \"big brother.\"\n",
      "the macintosh's minimal memory became apparent, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be expanded easily. it also lacked a hard disk drive or the means to easily attach one. many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue. suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512 kb or removing the computer's 16 memory chips and replacing them with larger-capacity chips, a tedious and difficult operation. in october 1984, apple introduced the macintosh 512k, with quadruple the memory of the original, at a price of us$3,195 . it also offered an upgrade for 128k macs that involved replacing the logic board.\n",

      "in 1998, apple introduced its new imac which, like the original 128k mac, was an all-in-one computer. its translucent plastic case, originally bondi blue and later various additional colors, is considered an industrial design landmark of the late 1990s. the imac did away with most of apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as scsi and adb, in favor of two usb ports. it replaced a floppy disk drive with a cd-rom drive for installing software, but was incapable of writing to cds or other media without external third-party hardware. the imac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days. it made the company an annual profit of us$309 million, apple's first profitable year since michael spindler took over as ceo in 1995 . this aesthetic was applied to the power macintosh and later the ibook, apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of apple's \"four-square product matrix\" (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals). more than 140,000 pre-orders were placed before it started shipping in september, and by october proved to be a large success.\n",

      "tuvalu participates in the operations of the pacific island forum fisheries agency (ffa) and the western and central pacific fisheries commission (wcpfc). the tuvaluan government, the us government, and the governments of other pacific islands, are parties to the south pacific tuna treaty (sptt), which entered into force in 1988 . tuvalu is also a member of the nauru agreement which addresses the management of tuna purse seine fishing in the tropical western pacific. in may 2013 representatives from the united states and the pacific islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the multilateral fisheries treaty (which encompasses the south pacific tuna treaty) to confirm access to the fisheries in the western and central pacific for us tuna boats for 18 months. tuvalu and the other members of the pacific island forum fisheries agency (ffa) and the united states have settled a tuna fishing deal for 2015; a longer term deal will be negotiated. the treaty is an extension of the nauru agreement and provides for us flagged purse seine vessels to fish 8,300 days in the region in return for a payment of us$90 million made up by tuna fishing industry and us-government contributions. in 2015 tuvalu has refused to sell fishing days to certain nations and fleets that have blocked tuvaluan initiatives to develop and sustain their own fishery.\n",
      "the first commercial leds were commonly used as replacements for incandescent and neon indicator lamps, and in seven-segment displays, first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment, then later in such appliances as tvs, radios, telephones, calculators, as well as watches (see list of signal uses). until 1968, visible and infrared leds were extremely costly, in the order of us$200 per unit, and so had little practical use. the monsanto company was the first organization to mass-produce visible leds, using gallium arsenide phosphide (gaasp) in 1968 to produce red leds suitable for indicators. hewlett packard (hp) introduced leds in 1968, initially using gaasp supplied by monsanto. these red leds were bright enough only for use as indicators, as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area. readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible. later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment. in the 1970s commercially successful led devices at less than five cents each were produced by fairchild optoelectronics. these devices employed compound semiconductor chips fabricated with the planar process invented by dr. jean hoerni at fairchild semiconductor. the combination of planar processing for chip fabrication and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at fairchild led by optoelectronics pioneer thomas brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions. these methods continue to be used by led producers.\n",
